> A school house leaderboard system  :trophy:

## Overview

Why settle for boring plastic cards telling you where your school house currently stands? Or even worse, wait till the end of the competiton? When you can get live updates of who's on top. A fun little project I built for my school during my **Presidential** term in 2020-2021.

This leaderboard system uses SVGs along with [d3-scale](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale). Firebase PaaS for authentication and cloud firestore for storing points.
